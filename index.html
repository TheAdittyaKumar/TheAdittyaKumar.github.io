He has done some tremendous work as a Graphics Designer for Oroddho Health, such as designing the black rendition of our logo in support of the #BLM and creating the special cover photo for our Facebook page on our first anniversary. Despite being the youngest member of the Oroddho Health team, his work ethic is admired even by the most senior members of our Executive Committee. Sky seems to be the limit for this talented man, and he will surely be an asset and a reliable team player wherever he chooses to work.</p>
